Description
Application to create and share notes in plain and encrypted format.

=================================================
Project name
- Secure Notes / snt
- Safe Notes / snt

=================================================
Desired features

Store
- notes can be stored locally (local encrypted DB) and in external store (access with service)
- Store access provider (local/remote) should be easily changed with time (config)
- allow to use several stores
- allow to synchronize local (file) DB with clouds

Notes
- allow to manage note format (general - text, other - site, card, host etc.)
- allow to manage notes hierarchy
- allow to set note notification time.
- allow to set note expiry time (to remote after some time)

API
- API between local and external store should be same
- external API should use P2P encryption for all content (key generates with session)

GUI
- desktop client
- android client
- simple web client

Encryption
- allow to encrypt note with master-password or another type of secure access.
- allow to change master-password on some cases with other security checks (fingerprint, etc)

Share
- allow to share part of substore (file or secured link)
- share access: read, modify
- share options: current, subtree

Other:
- ability to create backups with cron
- lock application when it is not used for X minutes

=================================================
Goals:
- improve java skills (java 8, java 9)
- get in touch with android development
- Try out libraries and instruments:
    - spring
    - kotlin

=================================================
Libraries and instruments
- Desktop GUI: JavaFX
- Web UI: ?
- Data serialization: JSON
- Remote API: REST/JSON (maybe JSON-pure API but not RESTful)
- JAX-RS library: CXF
- Local DB: HSQLDB, SQLite (both).
- Remote DB: PostgreSQL
- Remote application server: ServiceMix (newest)
- Encryption library: Bouncy Castle
